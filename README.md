# Day 1 - Advent of Code 2015

## Description

Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.

An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.

The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.

## Question 1 

What floor does Santa end up on?

## Question 2

Now, given the same instructions, when does Santa first enter the basement? (floor -1)
